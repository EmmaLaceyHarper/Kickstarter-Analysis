# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview
In our Kickstarter analysis project, We are helping Louise analyse different fundraising campaigns and their varying success. Through this analysis we have studied various goals set by Louise and the pledges made by donors. Diving deeper into the analysis we siloed the types of productions that had goals associated with them and analysed their levels of success. Through this process we helped Lousie determine which campaigns were most successful and why. 
### Purpose
The goal of our analysis was to help Louise better focus her fundraising efforts in order to capture the most donations in the most efficient way possible. This allows for better use of resources and higher campaign success rates. 
## Analysis and Challenges
There were various challenges to creating meaningful analysis to the underlying campaign data. First, the dataset was large and needed massaging in order to extrapolate consequential conclusions. The first challange was creating a dataset of years in which the campaigns took place, this required the application of the excel formula, Year(). Following that there were challanges to create a pivot table in order and sorting and editing needed to be completed before the pivot table showed material data with which to analyse. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Our first set of analyses centered around campaign success outcomes based on the launch date of the campaigns. Here we were only interested in understanding the lauch date relavance on campaigns focused on theater productions. For this we sorted the data by the Parent Category of theater and focused in on the various months in which the campaigns were launched. Through this analysis it is clear that there is a correlation between time of year and success or failure of campaigns. It appears that the most campaigns were launched in the months of May and June and the success rate of those campaigns were higher than those in the other months of the year. Additionally, campaigns launched in October and December were particularly unsuccessful. Therefore it would be my recommendation to Louise to launch her campaigns in the months of May and June. Please see the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date for reference. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99626046/155912888-84e8c6b8-ef5c-4300-8e44-9ecc7852a2e3.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Our second set of analyses focused on campaign success outcomes based on the monetary size of the goal in USD. Although this analysis did return some discernable trends, the results were more nebulous than the first analysis. The goals for these campaigns ranged significantly in size from under $1000 to over $50000 USD and returned varying degrees of success. The $1000 to $4999 category was by far the most popular goal size, and as determined by the percentage of campaigns tha reached their goals, it appears that goals that were sized appropriately were the most successful. The highest percentage of success was seen in the $5000 USD and under categories. Alternatively, although the goals that were $35000 to $44999 USD in size were outliers, it seems that they had a high level of success with the few goals in those categories. Please refer to the chart Outcomes Based on Goals for data on these goals. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99626046/155913901-1bf866c1-07fc-4261-af33-f801a28d77a6.png)
### Challanges
I found the outcomes based on goals Countifs () formula the most challenging in this excersize. At first I did not include the if statement that sorted out only the theater/play campaigns, but quickly realized my numbers were not adding up. After this realization I fixed my error and the formula returned values consistent with the task at hand. 
## Results
- Conclusions from the Outcomes Based on Launch Date: It appears that the most campaigns were launched in the months of May and June and the success rate of those campaigns were higher than those in the other months of the year. Additionally, campaigns launched in October and December were particularly unsuccessful. Therefore it would be my recommendation to Louise to launch her campaigns in the months of May and June and to refrain from launching campaigns in October and December. 
- Conclusions from the Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Louise should keep her campaign goals under $5000 unless she has a specific donor in mind that might fit within the outlier category. For those campaigns she can set the dollar amount much higher and have a decent level of success. 
- Limitations of this dataset are possible causations versus correlations. 
- I believe we could have created bar charts showing the most successful campaigns and that would have shown us a different way to look at the same information. Additionally, we could have sorted the data differently to look at years instead of months and that would have let us extrapolate different information about the same dataset.
